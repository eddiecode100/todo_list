## TodoLibre

Lightweight Todo application developed in C++ 20.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * You'll need the following development libraries installed:
        * **cmake && make:** Generate and build Makefiles. [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/)
2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eddiecode100/todolibre.git
    ```
3. **Build the Project:**
   The build process might vary depending on your system and development environment. Here's a general guideline:
    * Navigate to the project directory.
    * Run CMake to generate the build files:
        ```bash
        cmake .
        ```
    * Build the project using the appropriate command based on the generated build system (e.g., `make` for Makefiles).

**Running the Project:**

Once the project is built, you should have an executable file (e.g., `todolibre`). Run it from the command line:

```bash
./todolibre
```
